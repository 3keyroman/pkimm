        description: |
          Trusted and secure PKI must be properly managed and supported by the organization. The existence of a strategy and vision for the PKI is one of the key factors for the success of the PKI and contributes to the overall maturity. The strategy and vision should be aligned with the organizational goals and approach and should be followed and measured regularly.

          Formal documentation about the business drivers, scope, and design of the PKI helps to ensure that the PKI is properly aligned and understood to support the organizational. The documentation should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that the PKI is aligned with the organizational goals and needs.

          Undefined or unclear understanding and leadership can cause loss of the established trust and can lead to the failure of the PKI quickly.

            description: "Organizational sponsor and support"
            guidance: |
              The success of the PKI implementation highly depends on the organization top management support. Top management typically also acts as a sponsor of the PKI, meaning that they allocate and approve budget needed to build and maintain the PKI.

              The basic assumption is that the established digital trust is going to be maintained and developed for years, and therefore it is important to have a long-term vision and strategy for the PKI. The strategy and vision should be aligned with the overall organizational goals and approach.
            assessment: |
              The following is sample evidence that can be used to assess the requirement:
              - Interview with the top management
              - Documented strategy and vision

            guidance: |
              The scope of the PKI should be clearly defined and documented. The scope should be defined in terms of the use-cases that the PKI is going to support. Each use-case can have a different requirements and therefore different strategy. The use-cases should be defined in terms of the business drivers that are going to be supported by the PKI. Business drivers helps to document alignment with the overall organizational goals.

              The scope and business drivers can be considered as a formal high-level overview of the PKI strategy and vision.
              Its purpose is also to create a common understanding of the organizational PKI and to provide direction for the detailed design and implementation.
              The target audience consists typically of architects, experts, advisors, management, and sponsors.
            assessment: |
              The following is sample evidence that can be used to assess the requirement:
              - Documented scope of the PKI

            guidance: |
              The architecture and design of the PKI should be documented to provide a clear understanding of the implementation and technologies that are involved. The architecture and design should be aligned with the scope and business drivers for the PKI and should be reviewed and updated regularly.

              The architecture and design typically consists of the following:
              - Functional and technical design description
              - Description of logical components
              - Network infrastructure design
              - Technology involved
              - Integration requirements and interfaces (APIs)
              - Support systems (such as IAM, logging, monitoring, etc.)

              - Security requirements
              - Deployment options
              - Staging and testing

              The architecture and design are further used for the implementation of the PKI and serves as an input for the PKI team. It can be also used for the procurement of the PKI components and services that are needed for the implementation.

        name: "Policies and documentation"
        description: |
          Documented policies plays an important role in the secure and consistent management of the PKI. The goal is to minimize financial and operational threats and risks in the digital world. Well-described policies and security measures increase overall trust in the ecosystem of trust services and are a condition for successful operation. The basis for these matters lies in relevant laws and regulations, international standards and best practices.

          It consists of:
          - formal policies and practice statements for supported PKI services and use-cases
          - formal management of agreements between parties involved in the PKI
          - certificate and key management rules
          - roles and responsibilities in the management of the PKI
          - documented disclosure statements
          - maintenance and review of policies and documentation
          - code of practice for information security management, techniques and risk management

          Properly documented policies keeps the PKI assets trusted over the time and serves as a basis for integrated processes and procedures. It is a living management system that is continuously updated and changed as technologies, security, and compliance requirements change.

          The Certificate Policy (CP) defines the overall policies and requirements of a PKI, the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) provides detailed operational procedures followed by the Certification Authority (CA), and the disclosure statement offers transparency about the CA's identity and services to relying parties.

            guidance: |
              Each PKI implementation and use case is different, therefore it requires different care. The scope of policies that are applicable for the implementation should be defined and documented. When the proper description of the policies scope is provided, it helps all parties involved to understand the purpose of the policies and their applicability.

              The scope can include the following:
              - Identification of the policies required for the implementation
              - Reasoning why the policies are required or not required
              - Structure of policies and documentation

            description: "Certificate policy is documented and published"
            guidance: |
              Certificate Policy (CP) is used to establish the controls of the issuing party and the roles and responsibilities of its entities for the specific PKI implementation and use case. It's used to provide assurance to partners and show the trustworthiness by the use of standards. It can be considered as a high level contract between the parties involved in the PKI and therefore should be published and available to all parties involved.

              CPs are described in a document form where the content may differ. Multiple policies can be part of a single document for different use cases. A CP contains a set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of applications with common security requirements or level of security (for instance certificates for the purpose of: persons, domains, organizations, authenticity and confidentiality, services). To uniquely identify the purpose of the certificates the CP contains unique numbers (Object Identifier, OID) which needs to be registered.

              In general a CP addresses the following items:
              - Types of certificates
              - Document name and identification
              - PKI participants
              - Certificate usage
              - Policy administration
              - Definitions
              - Publication and repository responsibilities
              - Identification and authentication
              - Certificate life-cycle operational requirements
              - Facility management and operational controls
              - Technical security controls
              - Certificate, CRL, and OCSP profiles
              - Compliance audit and other assessments
                - Other business and legal matters
            assessment: |
              - The CP is properly documented in its full scope
              - The CP clearly defines the scope of the policy, such as the purpose of the security and assurance levels, the type and use of its certificates and parties involved
              - The legal rights and responsibilities of parties are described in the CP
              - CP has listed correct object identifiers for the purpose it's used for

            guidance: |
              In addition to a CP, there is typically a Certification Practice Statement (CPS). While a CP is more at a strategic level, detailed information about how things should be carried out is part of a CPS (tactical level). The CP and CPS can be combined into a single managed document, however they are typically split for most of the PKI implementations for better orientation.

              The CPS covers the same items as the CP, but includes technical detail of how the CP is implemented. All parties involved in the PKI should be aware of the CPS and follow it. The CPS is a living document that is continuously updated and changed as technologies, security, and compliance requirements change.
            assessment: |
              - The CPS is properly documented in its full scope
              - CPS is published and available to all parties involved

              The disclosure statement (DS) is a document that describes the PKI and its services. It refers to a document that discloses the relevant information about the CA and its services to the relying parties.

              It typically includes information like:
              - CA's identity, legal status, and contact information
              - Certificate types, verification procedures and compliance with standards
              - Reliance limits

              - Privacy policy
              - Refund policy and claims
              - Information on audit and compliance

              The purpose of a DS is to provide transparency to relying parties, allowing them to assess the trustworthiness and reliability of the CA before relying on its certificates.
            assessment: |

        description: |
          Compliance refers to the ability of an organization to adhere to relevant laws, regulations, and standards related to the scope of the PKI. A properly implemented PKI Compliance program ensures that an organization's PKI is protected from threats and risks that could result in financial loss, reputational damage, legal liabilities, or eventually in the loss of trust.

          The compliance process helps to manage a PKI in a way that meets legal and regulatory requirements, and ensures information is used and protected appropriately, according to defined and documented policies and practices statements.

          Compliance is important for several reasons, including:
          - It supports the risk management process associated with the PKI assets
          - Minimize reputation issues that can lead to the loss of trust
          - Provides assurance for the relying parties and subscribers
          - Proves adherence to legal requirements

          Overall, compliance and related procedures help to ensure that the PKI is managed and maintained according to the relevant laws, regulations, and standards. This minimizes the risk of loss of trust and provides assurance to PKI participants.

              Compliance policies are a critical component of an organization’s risk management strategy to help ensure that the PKI system is secure, reliable, trustworthy, and meets any applicable regulatory requirements.

              By defining appropriate policies and related procedures and communicating these to all stakeholders who rely on the PKI, the organization can ensure that administrators, operators, and users are properly authenticated and authorized to access the system and that appropriate controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the PKI.

              Having a sound set of compliance policies defined, implemented, and communicated can help to demonstrate that the organization took reasonable steps to protect the PKI and may result in reduced legal liability in the event of a breach due to improper or malicious use of the PKI.

              The compliance policies typically include:
              - Laws, industry regulations and government legislation that apply to the organization business and PKI
              - Roles and responsibilities
              - Compliance program management requirements
              - Reporting and auditing requirements
              - References to relevant documents (anti-trust, anti-fraud, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, due diligence, etc.)
              - Any other relevant information that rule compliance

            description: A program to monitor compliance with the policies is established
            guidance: |
              A PKI compliance monitoring program typically involves ongoing monitoring and testing of the controls and procedures to detect potential compliance violations associated with rules and regulations that govern the issuance, update, or revocation of certificates.

              These programs often include a risk assessment to identify and assess potential risks that could lead to non-compliance, including regulatory changes, operational changes, or employee turnover.

              The monitoring process may include reviewing documentation, conducting interviews with key stakeholders, and reporting any issues or compliance violations.  Reporting from compliance monitoring should be communicated to those stakeholders who committed the violation(s) and those stakeholders who are empowered to take corrective action to address the violations observed.
            assessment: |
              - Documented practices regarding periodic and aperiodic compliance assessments

              Within the organization, there should exist clear and well documented guidelines outlining which individual, group or team is responsible for ensuring that PKI policies are being followed. This applies to governance and oversight in addition to operational policies and procedures.

              Documenting specifically "who" shall be responsible for ensuring PKI policies are being enforced enhances accountability and trustworthiness of the PKI by enforcing the mentality that "someone is watching".  This will help to mitigate risks associated with improper or malicious acts.
            assessment: |

            guidance: |
              To better understand the relevance to PKI, one should understand the differences between laws, regulations, and standards.

              Laws are legal rules that are enacted by a governing body, such as a federal, state or local government.  They are binding and enforceable by the legal system within the jurisdiction of the governing body that enacted them.  Violating law can lead to legal consequences, such as fines or imprisonment.

              Regulations are derived from laws and are often meant to supplement and clarify the broader provisions outlined in the laws.  Compliance with regulations is mandatory and non-compliance can result in penalties or other legal consequences.

              Standards are voluntary guidelines or specifications typically established by a particular industry group or standards organization.  Standards usually define best practices, technical specifications, quality benchmarks, and other criteria and are meant as a means of ensuring consistency, interoperability, and quality.  Typically, compliance with standards is not legally required, however, lack of conformance to standards can lead to diminished interoperability and reduced trust.

              With respect to PKI, it is very important to understand what laws, regulations and standards are relevant to the PKI and its ancillary systems.  For example, given that PKI involves cryptography, one must be certain to adhere to government laws regarding use and deployment of cryptographic products and solutions.

              And, many times, a PKI will make use of hardware cryptographic modules for key generation and storage.  Therefore, it’s critical to ensure that the hardware cryptographic modules comply with the relevant standards. There are many laws, regulations and standards that apply to PKI.  As such, it is necessary to maintain a list of the ones that are relevant to your organization to help ensure that none are being overlooked.

        description: |
          Proper and effective processes and procedures related to PKI operations and management are essential for the successful implementation of the PKI. The processes and procedures should be aligned with the overall organizational policies and statements.

          Process is a set of activities that are performed in a specific order to achieve a specific goal. The process should be documented and measured. The process is also repeatable and can be improved over time, based on the evaluation, feedback, or risk assessment. The scope of the processes is defined by the policies.

          Procedure is a set of instructions that describe how to perform a specific task. The procedure should be also documented and can be used as a reference for the process. Procedure can include specific instructions for the process, such as how to perform a specific task, or how to use a specific tool.

          Processes and procedure typically cover (but are not limited to) the following areas:
          - infrastructure management
          - data privacy and security
          - business continuity, disaster recovery, contingency planning
          - supply chain management

              The alignment with the policies helps to ensure that the processes and procedures are aligned with the PKI implementation goals and needs, and can be effectively trusted over the time. A simple matrix can be used to ensure that all applicable policies and statements are covered by the processes and procedures.

              The completeness of the processes and procedures can be evaluated by the risk assessment, audit, or by the feedback from the users.

          Key management is the set of techniques and procedures supporting the establishment and maintenance of keying relationships between parties and components in the public key infrastructure. Key management encompasses techniques and procedures supporting:
          - Initialization of system users and components;
          - Generation, distribution, and installation of keying material;
          - Controlling the use of keying material;
          - Update, revocation, and destruction of keying material; and
          - Storage, backup/recovery, and archival of keying material.

          The key management is important for the PKI to maintain trust. It should be an integral part of the PKI procedures. Proper key management is one of the basic stones on which the PKI stands and relies on.

              The lifecycle phases contains appropriate description of the procedure such as:
              - Prerequisites for execution
              - Required roles and permissions
              - Procedure and records

            guidance: |
              Protocols and encryption strengths may quickly change or be deprecated due to identification of vulnerabilities or design flaws. In order to support current and future data security needs, the organization should know where cryptography is used and understand how they would be able to respond rapidly to changes impacting the strength of their cryptographic implementations.
              
              Specific rules and boundaries to be applied for cryptographic cipher suites and protocols should be documented in encryption management policy that reflect the current status of cryptography practice.
              
              Cipher suites and protocols should be regularly checked against the implemented technology and configuration. Any deviation from the documented and allowed protocols should be fixed.

          Certificate management is the set of techniques and procedures supporting certificate lifecycle management. Certificate management encompasses techniques and procedures supporting:
          - Definition of certificate profiles
          - Generation of certificates
          - Installation and orchestration of certificates
          - Inventory of certificates
          - State management of certificates, i.e. expiration and revocation
          - Discovery of certificates

          The techniques can be applied to an organization that makes use of PKI, or from an organization (or part of an organization) that operates a PKI for others. This category primarily targets an organization from a usage perspective, albeit the certificate lifecycle management is equally important for an organization that operates a PKI for someone else.

              Issuance of certificates follow specific procedures, be it manual processes or automated processes using standard or non-standard PKI protocol. An organization should be clear about the full life cycle management of certificates:
              1. Certificate Application and the validation procedures used, by RAs and CAs
              2. Certificate Issuance and protocols used for enrollment, on-line and off-line
              3. Certificate Renewal, Re-key and Modification, upon expiration or other causes
                - Process of monitoring certificates for expiration and timely renewal processes prevent common issues
              4. Certificate Revocation
                - When certificates need to be revoked it is important to have a well-defined certificate revocation process:
                  - How subjects can request a certificate be revoked
                  - How to report misuse of certificates
                  - Expected time for revocation to be completed after a revocation request
              5. Certificate status dissemination
                - How revocation information is disseminated to relying parties
              6. Key escrow and recovery
              7. Trust anchor management
                - Trust anchors on machines and devices are a key point of trust management in the organization. Unmanaged trust stores can cause both outages and security issues.

            guidance: |
              Certificate inventory consists of all known certificates and provides an overview of known certificates in the organization. Certificates in inventory are subject to certificate lifecycle management. The certificate inventory is important for the organization because:
              - It provides immediate access to the current status of certificates
              - Provides possibility to react on certificate-related events (compromise, change, expiration, etc.)
              - Understand impact of lifecycle changes
              - It gives information on all locations of certificates
              - Can enforce and maintain ownership of certificates

              The certificate inventory therefore consists of information related to certificate like certificate attributes, validity and validation information, fingerprint and serial number, trust chain, owner, public key, signature algorithm, certificate type, compliance information, certificate locations, change history, or any other attributes and properties of the certificates that is required.

            guidance: |
              Certificate discovery process protects an organization from unknown certificates that may be deployed in the infrastructure. Unknown certificates may be further issued by unauthorized certification authorities and mislead users of services. Certificate discovery helps to maintain current inventory of certificates, but does not depend on the inventory and is not nessecary to maintain an inventory. Certificate discovery process should be implemented based on supported certificates and use-cases, for example:
              - To scan the network for certificates used on known protocols and ports to discover certificates that can potentially cause service outage or breach
              - Search for the certificates on file system to discover unauthorized or unsecured certificates

              Discovery process should be run frequently on the specified locations and the certificate inventory should be updated based on the results of the certificate discovery to keep it current.
            assessment: |
              - Documented certificate discovery requirements
              - Documented certificate discovery process and frequency

        description: |
          The PKI implementation is a combination of software, hardware, network service, and resources that are needed to operate and manage the environment.
          The environment can be hosted on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.

          Independent of the hosting model, the PKI environment needs to be properly managed and maintained, which requires resources and processes.
          The infrastructure management refers to management of the technical and operational components of the PKI environment, which includes software, hardware, network, equipment, facilities, and other related resources.

          The PKI components may be distributed across multiple locations and managed by different teams. Therefore, it is important to have a clear description of the operational infrastructure with all dependencies and prerequisites. The infrastructure management should be aligned with the overall strategy of the organization and the scope of the PKI.

          When the infrastructure and environment where the PKI is implemented are not effectively managed and maintained, the complexity of the environment increases and the risk of failure increases as well. The infrastructure is often one of the key targets for attackers, therefore it is important to ensure that it is properly secured and available.

            description: Separation and segmentation principles are applied
            guidance: |
              The PKI environment should be properly separated and segmented from other environments and systems. The separation and segmentation should be applied on all levels, including network, infrastructure, and application. The separation and segmentation should be applied based on the security requirements and risk assessment.
              Segmentation isolates the PKI environment from the remaining environment and reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data leakage. It also helps to reduce the impact of a potential compromise of the PKI environment from other systems and environments. Segmentation can be achieved using a number of physical or logical methods, such as:
              - Properly configured internal network security controls
              - Routers with strong access control lists
              - Other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network
              For the proper maintenance of the infrastructure and deployed PKI components, the staging/testing environment should be available in the same configuration as the production environment. If needed, development environments can be used for testing and development purposes.
              Production, staging, and development environments should be logically separated and isolated from each other, including the data that is used in the environments.

        name: "Change management and agility"
        description: |
          Change management and agility is important to control the PKI implementation and configuration changes, adjustments, modifications, and improvements. Technologies are changing fast and the PKI needs to be able to adapt to the changes.
           The same applies for security vulnerabilities, deprecation of algorithms, and other changes that can significantly affect the PKI.

          The change management should provide a robust and reliable process to ensure that every change is properly assessed, approved, and implemented. The process should be aligned with the organizational change management process and should be followed by all stakeholders.

          Agility means that the PKI is able to adapt to the changes quickly and efficiently. Agility is applied to technologies, processes, algorithms, and other parts of the PKI implementation. Efficient adaptation to the changes makes the PKI more reliable and trustworthy, reducing operational risks.

            guidance: |
              Agility provides the ability to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently. Agility and change management are closely related and should be considered together. The future-proof PKI implementation should be able to identify the requirements for agility and implement them in a timely manner.

              Agility can be considered on operational and technical levels. Operational agility means that the PKI is able to adapt to changes in the operational environment, including any changes to the organizational structure, processes, and other operational aspects. Technical agility means that the PKI is able to adapt to changes in the technologies, algorithms, protocols, and other technical aspects.

              Identification of requirements where agility is needed is important to ensure changes are implemented when needed.

              Cyber-security management covers activities to ensure that the PKI is protected against known and zero-day vulnerabilities, cyberattacks and other threats. The operational procedures and technologies are evolving and the PKI needs to be able to adapt to the changes. Without knowing the threats and vulnerabilities, it is not possible to plan for the resilience and properly plan for incident response.

              Incident response planning helps to ensure that the organization is able to respond to the suspected incidents. Incident response plans should be documented and tested regularly. The result of executed incident response plans should be documented and used to improve the plan, even if it was a false alarm.

              Cyber-security management and incident planning covers important aspects such as vulnerability management and security operations center (SOC) identification and response to potential incidents.

              The business continuity planning and disaster recovery are the key activities to ensure availability of the PKI operations. The business continuity planning is used to define the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for the PKI. The RTO and RPO are used to define the required resources and their availability.

              Requirements for the business continuity and disaster recovery should be properly defined. It contains backups of the PKI resources, such as hardware security modules (HSM), databases, configuration files, etc. The availability of backups should be tested regularly to ensure that the backups are available when needed, especially during the disaster.

              Proper measures are applied to identify the disaster and a communication matrix is maintained to ensure that the right people are informed about the disaster on time and the recovery process can be started.

              The following parts are typically covered:
              - Scope of the business continuity and disaster recovery
              - Roles and responsibilities
              - Activation of disaster recovery
              - Physical locations

            guidance: |
              Applicable technology should always be future proofed to ensure that the PKI is able to adapt to changes, and will support the organization PKI in the future when new standards, algorithms, and approach will be developed.

              When deciding to apply new technologies, or evaluating if the current technology is still suitable and support the goals of the PKI implementation, the following should be considered:
              - Technology is supported by the vendor
              - Industry standards are applied for interoperability and security
              - Review and references on the vendor and technology
              - Applicability of the technology for long-term use
              - Vulnerabilities and security reports of the technology
              - Integration capabilities and customizations needed
              - Open source vs. proprietary technology

            guidance: |
              Organization environments may change over time. The impact of changes can be in various forms, for example:
              - personnel can rotate in their positions, new people can be hired, or people can leave the organization
              - technologies are changing, therefore required skills and knowledge may change
              - procedures and eventually management of the PKI will be adjusted

              The organization needs to ensure that the competence of the personnel is maintained and the information is shared to not lose the knowledge introduced by changes within known and unknown variables. The organization should have a plan to ensure that the competence is maintained for the most critical parts of the PKI.

              The competence and information sharing is an important part to achieve the resilience of the PKI implementation by having relevant information and competencies ready when needed.

        description: |
          Automation of certificate management is the process of using technology to perform tasks with reduced human assistance. Automation is used to improve the efficiency of the PKI management and to reduce the risk of human error. Automation can be used to perform tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, or difficult to perform manually.

          On the other hand the automation can introduce new risks and challenges. The automation should be used only for tasks that are well-defined and that can be performed in a reliable way.

          Justified, well-designed, and documented automation of certificate lifecycle management can significantly contribute to the efficiency of the PKI management while reducing the risk of human error. However, automation is not a silver bullet and should be controlled, monitored, and audited to prevent the risk of misuse.

            guidance: |
              Every automated certificate management process should be properly described and documented. The documentation should contain information relevant to the process automation and understanding the reasons for automation. Monitoring, auditing, and potential measures and controls would be ineffective without proper description and understanding of the automation process.

              The description can include for example the following:

            guidance: |
              The automated process of certificate management can cause significant damage if misused or misconfigured. The monitoring and auditing of the automated process is essential to prevent the risk of misuse and to detect any potential issues, inefficiencies, or exceptions.

              The monitoring and auditing should be performed on a regular basis and should be aligned with the overall monitoring and auditing strategy of the organization.
              It should provide sufficient information to detect any potential issues with the automated process. For successful detection or identification of issues, proper expectations should be based on the description of the automated process.
            assessment: |
              Monitoring of automated processes should be supported by monitoring tools and technologies that can provide the necessary overview, reporting, and potential alerting in case of issues.

            guidance: |
              No automation is perfect and covers everything. There can be edge cases and other situations that were not part of the initial analysis or were simply forgotten. Therefore, there will always be exceptions and incidents that will require manual intervention. The automated process should be able to handle such exceptions and incidents in a way that will not cause any significant damage or disruption to the service.

              It may happen that some certificates are required to be handled manually and therefore the exception should be approved and documented. 

              Handling of exceptional situations should be covered in the documentation, stating what should be done in case of an exception or incident:
              - Communication of the exception
              - Approval of the exception
              - Incident handling and reporting
              - Any other relevant information

              The handling of exceptions should be tested and verified on a regular basis to ensure that the process is working as expected.

        name: "Interoperability"
        description: |
          Interoperability means the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged.

          A PKI is composed of multiple components, which are often provided by different vendors, or can be developed and maintained in-house. Interoperability keeps the PKI components working together and allows the PKI to function properly in the long term.

          Adopting open standards and protocols helps to ensure interoperability between PKI components and Relying Party (RP) applications and avoids vendor lock-in that may lead to interoperability issues in the future, especially when the PKI needs to be trusted for a long time, may have no control over RPs or needs to be scaled.

          Interoperability includes the following aspects:
          - Interface specifications
          - Data formats
          - Communication protocols
          - Algorithms
          - Open standards

          Main principles of interoperability are:
          - Transparency and openness
          - Technology neutrality
          - Reusability and scalability
          - Security and privacy
          - Accessibility

              Open standards are publicly available standards that are developed and maintained by communities or standardization bodies. Open standards are developed through a consensus-based process and are available to everyone without any restrictions. Open standards are usually free to use and implement.

              The open standards are important for interoperability as they are typically technology-agnostic and are supported by technologies and solutions. Open standards are applicable for interfaces, communication protocols, cryptographic algorithms, data formats, automation and orchestration, and other aspects of the PKI.

              The adoption of open standards significant increase interoperability and reduce the risk of vendor lock-in.

            description: Event logs from systems are collected
            guidance: |
              The event logs from systems should be collected and available for analysis, including correlation with other records. Centralized logging is recommended to ensure that the logs are collected and stored consistently. Solution like security information and event management (SIEM) can be used to collect and analyze the logs.

              The availability of records for analysis depends on understanding logging format and interpretation of the information, therefore each system should provide logs in a consistent format that can be further processed and analyzed (or automated).

              Logs and events should be collected from all systems that are relevant for the PKI implementation, such as key life cycle management events.

              The event should contain sufficient information to identify the event, including:
              - User identification
              - Type of event
              - Date and time
              - Success or failure indication
              - Origination of event
              - Identity or name of affected data, system component, or resource
              - Additional details
            assessment: |
              - Logs are collected from systems
              - Logs have a consistent format and can be further processed and analyzed
              - Review of records and their formatting
              - Review of configuration standards for logging
              - Interviews with personnel to check the understanding of logging format and interpretation of the information

            description: Audit trail can be reconstructed from audit logs
            guidance: |
              Audit logging should be implemented to ensure that the audit trail can be reconstructed from audit logs any time. Audit logs are typically recorded for any user executed events that are important for security of the PKI implementation. Audit logs should be stored in a secure location. The audit logs should be protected against unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

              Typically, the following events are important for security of the PKI implementation:
              - All individual user accesses to sensitive data
              - All actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges
              - Access to all audit trails
              - Invalid logical access attempts
              - Use of and changes to identification and authentication mechanisms - including but not limited to creation of new accounts and elevation of privileges - and all changes, additions, or deletions to accounts with root or administrative privileges
              - Initialization, stopping, or pausing of the audit logs
              - Creation and deletion of system-level objects
            assessment: |
              - Audit trail can be reconstructed from audit logs
              - Audit logs are stored in a secure location
              - Audit logs are protected against unauthorized access, modification, and deletion
              - Review of records

        description: |
          PKI is a complex system that requires a lot of resources to be managed and maintained. Proper sourcing of the resources is one of the key factors of a mature infrastructure that can maintain and improve trust over the time. The resources can be:
          - Financial resources needed to maintain the PKI
          - Computing resources like hardware, software, tools, technologies
          - Human resources (personnel)
          - Management resources like processes and procedures 

          Sourcing is a process of defining the required resources and their specification, availability, and management. Sourcing requires monitoring and periodic review of the resources needed and alignment with the overall strategy of the organization and scope of the PKI.

            description: Resources are identified and documented
            guidance: |
              Resources needed for proper management of the PKI are identified and documented. Resources should be aligned with the PKI scope and use-case(s) that should be supported. The main question to answer here is "Do we know what resources we need to manage the PKI?".
            assessment: |
              The following is sample evidence that can be used to assess the requirement:
              - Resource management process
              - Documented requirements on the resources
              - Categorization of resources (an example can be people, processes, procedures, tools, technologies)

            description: Resources are clearly defined
            guidance: |
              Identified resources should be properly defined and specified. The specification depends on the type of the resource and can include for example the following:
              - People: required skills to perform the tasks, roles, and responsibilities
              - Tools: description, supported technologies
              - Technologies: required functionality and performance
              - Financial resources: required budget, funding sources
              - Management resources: processes and procedures, inputs, outputs
              - Other resources: description, specification, requirements

              Without clearly defined resources, there could be misuse of the organization’s assets or inconsistent interaction with personnel and other parties, leading to insecure and untrusted implementation of the PKI.

            guidance: |
              Proper education plan is required to stay up to date with the development of the latest technologies, security practices, and controls that have impact on the PKI and its future development. 

              The education plan should establish a robust base for the personnel to gain relevant knowledge that are out of scope of the internal training plan, but should be aligned with it to ensure that the personnel are able to perform their duties and responsibilities. The education plan should cover:
              - Education requirements and prerequisites
              - Recommended education approach and methods
              - Approach to monitor and assess the education results

              Methods to provide education can vary:
              - Internal or external courses
              - Incentives and rewards
              - Mentoring, coaching, and shadowing
              - Competitions and challenges
            assessment: |
              - Review education plan and its alignment with the training plan
              - Interview personnel to verify their educational goals
              - Validate education records
